 **AI Project | Language Translation Tool (Python)**

I developed a **Language Translation Tool** using **Python** as part of the **CodeAlpha Artificial Intelligence Tasks**. This project focuses on applying **Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** concepts to solve real-world language barriers.

🔹 **Project Highlights**
• Console-based application (no UI)
• Translates text between multiple languages
• Supports source and target language selection
• Uses Google Translate API via `deep-translator`
• Simple, efficient, and beginner-friendly implementation

🔹 **Technologies Used**
Python | NLP | API Integration | deep-translator

🔹 **Key Learnings**
• Practical API integration in Python
• Understanding how AI handles language translation
• Writing clean and modular code
• Applying AI concepts to real-world problems
